# Adaptive Seating System

A modular seating system designed with furniture as a service in mind. Rethinking furniture for ever evolving lives in messy and complex systems.

## Changing Needs

Because people's living situation changes over time, most people won't stick with the same furniture forever. This adaptive seating system is designed to be reused and reconfigured. Paired with a service model it is an evolutionary system which can adapt to people's needs changing over time. With help of a digital twin, people can reconfigure their system online, swap damaged or broken parts or move it somewhere else.

## Configurations

One of the bigger challenges in designing modular furniture is having a collection of parts be a single object without compromising the plurality of the modular system. Plurality is important when imagining furniture as a service, as a more flexible modular system will allow people to put together something that more closely matches their needs.

## Circular

Furniture as a service creates a feedback loop with materials and information. Parts and materials are reused, and information about how people are using the system can be used to improve the service and industrial design.
