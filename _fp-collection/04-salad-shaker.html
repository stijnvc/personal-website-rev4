<p>This is a salad shaker design for a promotion of Bonduelle corn
products in Ahold Delhaize supermarkets. A salad shaker is a container for keeping your salad fresh. It has a
  separate compartment for dressing and croutons so your salad won't get soggy.
  When you are going to eat your salad, you can add the dressing and croutons
  and "shake" all of the ingredients to incorporate them.

<p>The very limited unit price was one of the biggest
challenges during this project. This simple design allowed functionality
to be at the desired level.</p>
