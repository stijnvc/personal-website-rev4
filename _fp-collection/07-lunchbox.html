  <h1>Lunchbox, 2017</h1>
  <p>A lot of plastic lunchboxes look just like that: plastic boxes. Plastic lunchboxes do have the great advantage of being nearly unbreakable, light, dishwasher safe and microwave safe. But why not design them more like actual tableware? I set out to design a lunchbox that has an aesthetic similar to what a ceramic piece of tableware could have.</p>

  <p>Besides just sandwiches, there is a lot more people like to bring as lunch. I strived to accommodate as many types of lunch foods as possible in this design.</p>
