<h1>Lunchbox: Like Tableware</h1>

<span class="meta">2017 / Arnhem</span>

<p>A lot of plastic lunchboxes look just like that: plastic boxes. Plastic
  lunchboxes do have the great advantage of being nearly unbreakable, light,
  dishwasher safe and microwave safe. But why not design them more like actual
  tableware? I set out to design a lunchbox that has an aesthetic similar to what
  a ceramic piece of tableware could have.</p>

<p>Besides just sandwiches, there is a lot more people like to bring as lunch.
  I strived to accommodate as many types of lunch foods as possible in this design.</p>
