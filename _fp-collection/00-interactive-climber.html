    <h1>Interactive Climber</h1>

    <p>For my graduation in 2019, I designed an Interactive Climber for <a href="https://playnetic.nl">Playnetic</a>'s new Traditionals product line. With this new product line Playnetic reimagined playground classics as innovative and interactive playground equipment.</p>

  <p>This climber features interactive discs that are suspended in the air by chains with rubber sleeving. Positioned at different
    heights they create a dynamic climbing experience. De discs detect if pressure is applied to them
    and can respond with light, sound and haptic effects depending on what game is activated.</p>

<p class=" a-l">Playnetic playground equipment works on Human Power. Energy for the interactive elements of this climber
  is generated by turning the charging wheel. Because of this sustainable way of generating energy, Playnetic playground equipment does not
  have to be connected to the power grid.</p>

  <p class=" a-l">Children have the constant urge to explore and push their boundaries.
  My ideation was focused around generating curiosity and letting children explore and play at their own pace: non-directive play.
  Interactive elements should stimulate their senses and make the climbing experience more engaging and immersive.</p>

    Climber during his internship with us. I have never worked with someone who
    keeps as much focus and is as aware of the steps in their design process as
    Stijn. In addition, he has all the practical skills needed to
    present and realize his designs.”</p></blockquote>
