  <h1>Adaptive Seating System, 2020</h1>

  <p>A modular seating system designed with furniture as a service in mind. Rethinking furniture for ever evolving lives in messy and complex systems.</p>

  <h1>Changing Needs</h1>

  <p>Because people's living situation changes over time, most people won't stick with the same furniture forever. This adaptive seating system is designed to be reused and reconfigured. Paired with a service model it is an evolutionary system which can adapt to people's needs changing over time. With help of a digital twin, people can reconfigure their system online, swap damaged or broken parts or move it somewhere else.</p>

  <h1>Configurations</h1>

  <p>One of the bigger challenges in designing modular furniture is having a collection of parts be a single object without compromising the plurality of the modular system. Plurality is important when imagining furniture as a service, as a more flexible modular system will allow people to put together something that more closely matches their needs. </p>

  <h1>Circular</h1>

  <p>Furniture as a service creates a feedback loop with materials and information. Parts and materials are reused, and information about how people are using the system can be used to improve the service and industrial design.</p>
