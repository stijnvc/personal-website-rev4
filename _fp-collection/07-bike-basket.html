<p>The plastic shopping bag is on its way out. Can we offer people that travel to
the grocery store by bike, a better and more user-friendly alternative?</p>

<p>This Bike Basket functions as a shopping basket when you are doing your shopping.
When traveling to and from home it can easily be mounted onto the back or front rack of your bike.
The mounting unit is attached to your bike using heavy duty tie-wraps: no tools required.</p>
