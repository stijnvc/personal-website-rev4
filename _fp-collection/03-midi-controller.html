<p>As a designer Iâ€™m fascinated by all the gear and devices
you can use to control or influence sound on the computer
(keyboards, launchpads, etc). In this 3-day project I set out
to create my own device. I build it on the Arduino platform
and it runs custom software to communicate with the
computer using the MIDI protocol. The housing is made
out of solid beechwood and features an exchangeable
plastic sheet as I/O shield.</p>
