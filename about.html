  <h1>About</h1>

<p>To me, design is about asking questions, collaboration and taking
  responsibility. I approach design problems from both a top-down and bottom-up
  perspective. This helps me to understand design problems both on an abstract
  level and on a human level. With this understanding of context I strive towards
  clarity and simplicity in my designs.</p>

<p>I am curious and critical in nature, combined with creativity, this is what
  has led me to pursue design as a career. I have never limited myself to one
  discipline within design. I've always taken a multidisciplinary approach.
  And while I think of design more as a mindset than a defined profession, I
  strongly believe that good design comes from a combination of mindset, knowledge
  and skill.</p>
  <p>
  Throughout the years I have acquired experience in all kinds of creative
  domains, ranging from graphic and industrial design, to video and music
  production, to web development and coding. The central theme in exploring
  all of these creative pursuits has always been mastering the creative process.
  </p>

<p>In 2019 I graduated from HAN University of
Applied Sciences in Industrial Product Design.
Since then industrial design has become my main focus.</p>

  <p>“I like to think of Stijn as a philosopher with a knack for design.
  Besides being a good listener, a thinker, someone who likes to
  understand complex challenges on an abstract level, he is able to turn
  his thoughts into solutions and new directions. Stijn is extremely
  focused on finding the truth and seeing things for what they really are,
  and pays close attention to detail. If you want things done right, not
  just nice, Stijn is a valuable asset to your team.”</p>
